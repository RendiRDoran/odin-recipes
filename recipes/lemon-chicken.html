    <h1>Lemon Chicken</h1>
    <p>Lemon Chicken is not a traditional Asian dish, but that does not make it any less delicious. This recipe is something that my husband and I make quite frequently. If you are looking for something that is akin to Asian food without straying too far from an American pallet, this is a great dish. It is especially popular with kids. I like this dish because of all of the citrus flavors that light up your senses.</p>
